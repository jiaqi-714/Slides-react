## Accessibility Guidelines

### Alt Text for Photo Content on Slides

- **Guideline**: Ensure that all photos and visual content on slides have descriptive alt text that accurately describes the image content. This helps users with visual impairments understand the context and content of the images.

### Text Visibility and Clarity

- **Guideline**: Always use text directly instead of images of text. Ensure that all icons used can be zoomed in without pixelation or loss of clarity, to accommodate users with visual impairments.

### Icon Usability

- **Guideline**: Icons used in creating content on slides and during the presentation creation process should be designed to be clear and easily recognizable. Enhance icon designs to be more accessible for users with reading difficulties.
